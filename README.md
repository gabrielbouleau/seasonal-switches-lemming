## Summary
Life has evolved different strategies to take advantage of seasonal constraints that are emblematic of boreal and arctic biomes. However, ecological theories often ignore seasonal changes for tractability or simplicity. Understanding the effect of seasonality may prove crucial as the changing climate puts more pressure on ecosystems we seek to preserve. Hybrid dynamical models are an efficient way to represent seasonal adaptations where switches in food web compositions account for species migrations and predator movements. We use the highly seasonal and cyclic dynamics of lemmings to showcase the utility of hybrid models. This simplified representation of community dynamics eases the study of conditions leading to cycles and facilitates parameterization with empirical data. We find that seasonal switches, accounting for the onset of reproduction of resident predators and the migration of mobile predators, drive cyclic fluctuations in lemming abundance. Our empirical investigation reveals that each predator alone does not reduce lemming growth rate enough to generate population cycles, which suggest that the predator community as a whole is responsible for the cyclic dynamics. This situation arises because each predator has unique adaptations to seasonality and impacts the dynamics in different but complementary ways. Our results have important implications for food web theories and conservation as they show how hybrid models can help understand complex seasonal dynamics and the importance of conserving seasonal switches in highly dynamic ecosystems. This is especially relevant in the Arctic considering that rapid warming has the potential to disrupt lemming population cycles and negatively affect their predators.
